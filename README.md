Hi!
I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need in whatever language I (kinda) know and that is fit for the job.
That helps me get a bit deeper into these languages and into developing in general.
Look around, see what I am doing - potentially laugh about it - and move on.
Or send me a PR to make something better.
I love learning new ways to make stuff better.
Oh yeah, these languages are mainly Python and Java, and I am currently learning JavaScript.

Well, here are GitHub's default ideas plus some additions in the same style, because I think they are actually pretty neat.

- ðŸŽ„ Currently [participating](https://github.com/kiriDevs/adventofcode) in [*Advent of Code*](https://adventofcode.com)!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own API and React-App for my Minecraft Server
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, both server-side (i.e. Node.js) and Frontend (using React)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with properly structuring different projects in different languages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating Minecraft Plugins - I'd say I'm at least okay at doing that
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Per E-Mail: [kiron@kirimcplay.tv](mailto:kiron@kirimcplay.tv)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any
- âš¡ Fun fact: Most of my projects come to life because I need something for something, check out the existing solutions and think "Why is this so complicated?", "Why doesn't this super-specific thing for my super-specific use-case exist?" or "I know this exists, but that'd be too easy for something that can't be *that* hard to do myself..." (I know, famous last words. And I can confirm: That is very accurate).
