- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Minecraft Plugin Library, called [kiriCore](https://github.com/kiriDevs/kiriCore)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning communication with APIs, my first tries can be seen here: [streamControlCenter](https://github.com/kiriDevs/streamControlCenter)
  - (This never reached it's name, it is only usable to check out a channel and change your own title using the TwitchAPI)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all the GitHub features.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating Minecraft Plugins - I'd say I'm at least okay at doing that
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Per E-Mail: [kiron@kirimcplay.tv](mailto:kiron@kirimcplay.tv)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him or they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: These points are most of the GitHub ideas for your profile description, because I am very uncreative!
