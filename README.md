Hi!
I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need in whatever language I (kinda) know and that is fit for the job.
That helps me get a bit deeper into these languages and into developing in general.
Look around, see what I am doing - potentially laugh about it - and move on.
Or send me a PR to make something better.
I love learning new ways to make stuff better.
I mainly use these languages:
  - Python
    - for smaller scripts
    - for [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com) (see [kiriDevs/adventofcode](https://github.com/kiriDevs/adventofcode))
  - Java
    - for Minecraft plugins (e.g. [kiriCore](https://github.com/kiriDevs/kiriCore))
    - for school stuff.
  - TypeScript
    - for Discord Bots with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
    - for websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) (e.g. [vplanweb](https://github.com/kiriDevs/vplanweb))
    - other small miscellaneous scripts

Well, here are GitHub's default ideas plus some additions in the same style, because I think they are actually pretty neat.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [a web app for my school substitution plan](https://github.com/kiriDevs/vplanweb).
  It's using `react` and `typescript`, built with `vite`.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and `react-router-dom`
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with properly structuring different projects in different languages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating Minecraft Plugins - I'd say I'm at least okay at doing that
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Per E-Mail: [kiron@kirimcplay.tv](mailto:kiron@kirimcplay.tv)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any
- âš¡ Fun fact: Package Managers for Windows exist to make installing things easier.
  And then you need a script to update all of your stuff.
  Because even if you only need 3 packages, a single manager won't have them all.
