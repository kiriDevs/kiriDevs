Hi!
I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need in whatever language I (kinda) know and that is fit for the job.
That helps me get a bit deeper into these languages and into developing in general.
Look around, see what I am doing - potentially laugh about it - and move on.
Or send me a PR to make something better.
I love learning new ways to make stuff better.
Oh yeah, these languages are mainly Python and Java, and I am currently learning JavaScript.

Well, here are GitHub's default ideas plus some additions in the same style, because I think they are actually pretty neat.

- ðŸŽ„ Currently [participating](https://github.com/kiriDevs/adventofcode) in [*Advent of Code*](https://adventofcode.com)!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/kiriDevs/dotfiles)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and React.js with TypeScript
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with properly structuring different projects in different languages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating Minecraft Plugins - I'd say I'm at least okay at doing that
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Per E-Mail: [kiron@kirimcplay.tv](mailto:kiron@kirimcplay.tv)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any
- âš¡ Fun fact: [New] **kiriDevs/kiriDevs** is now a special repository: its `README.md` will appear on your profile
  (yes GitHub still displays that for some reason whenever I commit to this, even though this is totally not new)
