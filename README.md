# Hi, I'm Kiri

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any
- :speech_balloon: Languages: German :de:, English :gb:

I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need / want to in whatever language I know
(though sometimes only barely) and that is (at least remotely) fit for the job.
Yes, it's chaotic sometimes, but that's all the fun!

I mainly use these languages:

- Python
  - for smaller scripts
  - for [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com) (see [kiriDevs/adventofcode](https://github.com/kiriDevs/adventofcode)) and similar "real-world" problems
- Java
  - for Minecraft plugins (e.g. [kiriCore](https://github.com/kiriDevs/kiriCore))
  - for university tasks / projects.
- TypeScript
  - for Discord Bots with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
  - for websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) (e.g. [vplanweb](https://github.com/kiriDevs/vplanweb))
  - other small miscellaneous scripts

I am also currently (planning on) learning:

- Svelte / SvelteKit for (web) UI development
- Rust (the programming language)
