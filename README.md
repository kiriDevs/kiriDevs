Hi!
I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need in whatever language I know (sometimes only barely) and that is (somewhat) fit for the job.
Yes, it's chaotic sometimes.
I'm currently studying computer science at KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)
That helps me get a bit deeper into the languages I use and into development concepts and strategy in general.
Look around, see what I am doing - potentially laugh about it - and move on.
Or send me a PR to make something better.
I love learning new ways to make stuff better.

I mainly use these languages:
- Python
  - for smaller scripts
  - for [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com) (see [kiriDevs/adventofcode](https://github.com/kiriDevs/adventofcode)) and similar "real-world" problems
- Java
  - for Minecraft plugins (e.g. [kiriCore](https://github.com/kiriDevs/kiriCore))
  - for school stuff.
- TypeScript
  - for Discord Bots with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
  - for websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) (e.g. [vplanweb](https://github.com/kiriDevs/vplanweb))
  - other small miscellaneous scripts

Well, here are GitHub's default ideas plus some additions in the same style, because I think they are actually pretty neat.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have three different Windows package managers, because no one has everything I need. I have a script to chain-update all of them.
