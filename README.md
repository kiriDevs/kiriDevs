### IMPORTANT message for users of [kiriCore](https://github.com/KiriMC-Plugins/kiriCore) and [survivalTools](https://github.com/KiriMC-Plugins/survivaltools):
**My Minecraft Plugins have relocated** to a GitHub organization: [KiriMC-Plugins](https://github.com/KiriMC-Plugins).
This should help keep things more organized, both for me and you.
Make sure to update your VCS link references, if you have any (including your `git remote`s!).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Minecraft Plugin Library, called [kiriCore](https://github.com/kiriDevs/kiriCore)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, mostly but not only server-side (i.e. Node.js)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with properly structuring different projects in different languages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating Minecraft Plugins - I'd say I'm at least okay at doing that
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Per E-Mail: [kiron@kirimcplay.tv](mailto:kiron@kirimcplay.tv)

- âš¡ Fun fact: These points are most of the GitHub ideas for your profile description, because I am very uncreative when it comes to adding interesting points.
