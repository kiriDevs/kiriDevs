Hi!
I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need in whatever language I know (sometimes only barely) and that is (somewhat) fit for the job.
Yes, it's chaotic sometimes.
I'm currently studying computer science at KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)
That helps me get a bit deeper into the languages I use and into development concepts and strategy in general.
Look around, see what I am doing - potentially laugh about it - and move on.
Or send me a PR to make something better.
I love learning new ways to make stuff better.

I'm just a random person from Germany, coding whatever stuff I need / want to in whatever language I know
(though sometimes only barely) and that is (at least remotely) fit for the job.
Yes, it's chaotic sometimes, but that's all the fun!

I mainly use these languages:

- Python
  - for smaller scripts
  - for [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com) (see [kiriDevs/adventofcode](https://github.com/kiriDevs/adventofcode)) and similar "real-world" problems
- Java
  - for Minecraft plugins (e.g. [kiriCore](https://github.com/kiriDevs/kiriCore))
  - for university tasks / projects.
- TypeScript
  - for Discord Bots with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
  - for websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) (e.g. [vplanweb](https://github.com/kiriDevs/vplanweb))
  - other small miscellaneous scripts

I am also currently (planning on) learning:

- Svelte / SvelteKit for (web) UI development
- Rust (the programming language)
